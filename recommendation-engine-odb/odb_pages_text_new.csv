packer further noted that knowing god through bible study is not just for scholars a simple bible reader and sermon hearer who is full of the holy spirit will develop a far deeper acquaintance with his god and savior than a more learned scholar who is content with being theologically correct unfortunately not all who study the bible do so with humble hearts with the goal of getting to know the savior better and becoming more like him in jesus day there were those who read the old testament scriptures yet they missed the very one they spoke of you study the scriptures diligently because you think that in them you have eternal life these are the very scriptures that testify about me yet you refuse to come to me to have life john 5:39–40 do you sometimes find yourself stumped as you read

navigation safe hands arthur jackson  march 5 like the unraveling of a rope the threads in dougs life were breaking one by one my mother had lost her prolonged battle with cancer a longterm romantic relationship was failing my finances were depleted my vocation was foggy    the emotional and spiritual darkness around me and within me was deep and debilitating and seemingly impenetrable writes pastor and sculptor doug merkey these collective events combined with living in a cramped attic became the setting from which his sculpture the hiding place emerged it depicts christs strong nailedscarred hands openly cupped together as a place of safety doug explained the design of his artwork this way: the sculpture is christs invitation to hide in him in psalm 32 david wrote as one who had found the ultimate safe placegod himself he offers us forgiveness from our sin vv 1–5 and encourages us to offer prayer in the midst of tumult v 6 in verse 7 the psalmist declares his trust in god: you are my hiding place you will protect me from trouble and surround me with songs of deliverance when trouble shows up where do you turn how good it is to know that when the fragile cords of our earthly existence begin to unravel we can run to the god who has provided eternal safety through the forgiving work of jesus timely resolution arthur jackson  december 26 the unresolved hurt between simon and geoffrey had persisted for years and simons attempts to reenter the relationship had been resisted upon hearing the news of the death of geoffreys mother simon traveled up country in kenya to attend her funeral service simon reflected on their encounter: i had no expectations at all in terms of how the whole thing would turn out but after the service we opened up and had a fruitful talk we hugged shared the moment prayed together and planned to meet again if only simon and geoffrey had been able to reconcile earlier so much ongoing pain could have been avoided the words of jesus in matthew 5:21–26 help to put unresolved relational tensions in perspective the anger that can lead to such rifts is a serious matter v 22 furthermore getting things in order relationally is a fitting prelude to worshiping god vv 23–24 the wise words of jesus to settle matters quickly with your adversary v 25 remind us that the sooner we do what we can to work toward reconciliation the better for all relationships are risky they demand workin our families in the workplace in educational settings and among people who share our faith in christ but as those who represent him the prince

1924–1998 plane was shot down during world war ii he was wounded in the leg by ground fire while parachuting to safety as a result he walked with a limp for the rest of his life he once noted i have a lame leg isnt it strange of god that he called me to preach the gospel in the himalaya mountains and preach in nepal he didbut not without opposition that included imprisonment in dungeons of death where prisoners faced extreme conditions in a span of fifteen years prem spent ten years in fourteen different prisons his bold witness however bore the fruit of changed lives for christ that included guards and prisoners who took the message of jesus to their own people peter faced opposition due to his faith in jesus and for being used by god to heal a man who was lame acts 4:9 but he used the opportunity to boldly speak for christ vv 8–13 though some today will also face the ire of hardhearted religious leaders vv 10–11 we also encounter individuals and groups who are spiritually destitute family members coworkers fellow students and others we share life and space with need to hear about the one in whom salvation is found v 12 who died as payment for our sins and was raised from the

have much to give you but i do have a good name so dont mess it up those wise weighty words were uttered by johnnie bettis as his son jerome left home for college jerome quoted his father in his professional american football hall of fame acceptance speech these sage words that jerome has carried with him throughout his life have been so influential that he closed his riveting speech with similar words to his own son son theres not much that i can give you thats more important than our good name a good name is vital for believers in jesus pauls words in colossians 3:12–17 remind us about who it is that we represent v 17 character is like clothing that we wear and this passage puts the jesus label of clothing on display: as gods chosen people    clothe yourselves with compassion kindness humility gentleness and patience bear with each other and forgive one another    and over all these virtues put on love vv 12–14 these are not just our sunday clotheswere to wear them everywhere all the time as god works in us to reflect him when our lives are characterized by these qualities we demonstrate that we have his name may we prayerfully and carefully represent him as he provides what we need studying the scriptures arthur jackson  october 21 j i packer 1926–2020 in his classic work knowing god spoke of four wellknown believers in christ whom he called beavers for the bible not all were trained scholars but each one exercised great care to know god by gnawing into the scripture like a beaver digs in and gnaws away at a tree packer further noted that knowing god through bible study is not just for scholars a simple bible reader and sermon hearer who is full of the holy spirit will develop a far deeper acquaintance with his god and savior than a more learned scholar who is content with being theologically correct unfortunately not all who study the bible do so with humble hearts with the goal of getting to know the savior better and becoming more like him in jesus day there were those who read the old testament scriptures yet they missed the very one they spoke of you study the scriptures diligently because you think that in them you have eternal life these are the very scriptures that testify about me yet you refuse to come to me to have life john 5:39–40 do you sometimes find yourself stumped as you read the bible or have you given up studying

bill perhaps you can identify with this dilemma or some other situation that puts you on the receiving end wanting to pay our own way is normal but there are occasions when we must humbly receive

your son make me like one of your hired servants v 19 hired servant his father would have no such thing in his fathers eyes he was a muchloved son whod come home as such he was met with a fathers

i lift my eyes to the mountains psalm 121:1 sometimes we simply need to lift our eyes a bit higher the psalmist pondered where his help came from maybe because the hilltops around israel were dotted with altars to pagan gods and often contained robbers or it could have been because the psalmist looked up beyond the hills to mount zion where the temple stood and remembered that the maker of heaven and earth was his covenant god v 2 either way to worship we must look up we have to lift our eyes higher than our circumstances higher than our troubles and trials higher than the empty promises of

forgiven and feels compassion these are good things to sing during the dark nights of our lives maybe thats where you find yourself: in a dark and difficult place wondering if god really is good

packiam  april 14 when i have to travel across time zones by air i try various remedies to avoid jet lag i think ive tried them all on one occasion i decided to adjust my inflight eating to the time zone where i was heading instead of eating dinner with the rest of the passengers i kept watching a movie and tried to fall asleep the hours of elective fasting were difficult and the breakfast that came right before we landed left much to be desired but living out of sorts with those around me worked it jolted my body clock into a new time zone paul knew that if believers in jesus were to truly reflect him in their lives they would need to live out of step with the world around them they were once darkness but now they were to live as children of light ephesians 5: 8 and what might that look like paul goes on to fill out the picture: the fruit of the light consists in all goodness justice and truth v 9 sleeping through dinner may have seemed foolish to the people on my flight but even as its midnight in the world as believers were called to live like its morning this may provoke scorn and opposition but in jesus we can walk in the way of love following the example of the one who loves

in a greater understanding of the importance of healthy relationships the research began with a group of 268 sophomores at harvard university in the 1930s and later expanded to among others 456 boston innercity residents researchers have conducted interviews with the participants and pored over their medical records every few years what theyve discovered is that close relationships are the biggest factor in predicting happiness and health it turns out that if we surround ourselves with the right people well likely experience a deeper sense of joy this appears to reflect what the apostle paul is describing in philippians 1 writing from prison paul cant help but tell his friends that he thanks god for them every time he remembers them praying with joy v 4 but these arent just any friends these are brothers and sisters in jesus who share in gods grace partners in the gospel with paul v 7 their relationship was one of sharing and mutualitya true fellowship shaped by gods love and the gospel itself yes friends are important but fellow companions in christ are catalysts of a true and deep joy the grace of god can bind us together like nothing else and even through the darkest seasons of life the joy that comes from that bond will last practice these things glenn packiam  march 10 as i helped my son with his math homework it began apparent he was less then enthusiastic about doing multiple problems related to the same concept ive got it dad he insisted hoping i would let him out doing all the problems i then gently explained to him that a concept is just a concept until we learn how to work it out in practice at the end of pauls letter to his friends in philippi he wrote about practice practice these things: whatever you learned received heard or saw in us philippians 4:9 here are five things he mentions: reconciliationas he urged euodia and syntyche to do vv 1–3 joyas he reminded his readers to cultivate v 4 gentlenessas he urged them to employ in their relation to the world v 5 prayeras he had modeled for them in person and in writing vv 6–7 and focusas he had shown even in prison v 8 reconciliation joy gentleness prayer and focusthings were called to live out as believers in jesus like any habit these virtues must be intentionally done in order to be cultivated but the good news of the gospel as paul had already told the philippians is that it is god

freedom v 6 jesus did come and although the darkness of the world can be disorienting may we experience the comfort of the forgiveness freedom and light found in christ live like its morning glenn packiam  april 14 when i have to travel across time zones by air i try various remedies to avoid jet lag i think ive tried them all on one occasion i decided to adjust my inflight eating to the time zone where i was heading instead of eating dinner with the rest of the passengers i kept watching a movie and tried to fall asleep the hours of elective fasting were difficult and the breakfast that came right before we landed left much to be desired but living out of sorts with those around me worked it jolted my body clock into a new time zone paul knew that if believers in jesus were to truly reflect him in their lives they would need to live out of step with the world around them they were once darkness but now they were to live as children of light ephesians 5: 8 and what might that look like paul goes on to fill out the picture: the fruit of the light consists in all goodness justice and truth v 9 sleeping through dinner may have seemed foolish to the people on my flight but even as its midnight in the world as believers were called to live like its morning this may provoke scorn and opposition but in jesus we can walk in the way of love following the example of the one who loves us and gave himself up for us as a fragrant offering and sacrifice to god v 2 companions in christ glenn packiam  april 6 the harvard study of adult development is a decadeslong project thats resulted in a greater understanding of the importance of healthy relationships the research began with a group of 268 sophomores at harvard university in the 1930s and later expanded to among others 456 boston innercity residents researchers have conducted interviews with the participants and pored over their medical records every few years what theyve discovered is that close relationships are the biggest factor in predicting happiness and health it turns out that if we surround ourselves with the right people well likely experience a deeper sense of joy this appears to reflect what the apostle paul is describing in philippians 1 writing from prison paul cant help but tell his friends that he thanks god for them every time he remembers them praying with joy v 4 but these arent just any friends these are brothers and sisters in jesus who share in gods grace partners in the gospel with paul v 7 their relationship was one of sharing and mutualitya true fellowship shaped by gods love and the gospel itself yes friends are important but fellow companions in christ are catalysts of a true and deep joy the grace of god can bind us together like nothing else and even through the darkest seasons of life the joy that comes from that bond will last practice these things glenn packiam  march 10 as i helped my son with his math homework it began apparent he was less then enthusiastic about doing multiple problems related to the same concept ive got it dad he insisted hoping i would let him out doing all the problems i then gently explained to him that a concept is just a concept until we learn how to work it out in practice at the end of pauls letter to his friends in philippi he wrote about practice practice these things: whatever you learned received heard or saw in us philippians 4:9 here are five things he mentions: reconciliationas he urged euodia and syntyche to do vv 1–3 joyas he reminded his readers to cultivate v 4 gentlenessas he urged them to employ in their relation to the world v 5 prayeras he had modeled for them in person and in writing vv 6–7 and focusas he had shown even in prison v 8 reconciliation joy gentleness prayer and focusthings were called to live out as believers in jesus like any habit these virtues must be intentionally done in order to be cultivated but the good news of the gospel as paul had already told the philippians is that it is god who works in you to will and to act in order to fulfill his good purpose 2:13 were never practicing in our own power god will provide what we need 4:19 no longer yourself glenn packiam  february 27 in the summer of 1859 monsieur charles blondin became the first person to cross niagara falls on a tightropesomething he would go on to do hundreds of times once he did it with his manager harry colcord on his back blondin gave colcord these instructions: look up harry    you are no longer colcord you are blondin    if i sway sway with me do not attempt to do any balancing yourself if you do we will both go to our death paul in essence said to the galatian believers: you cant walk the line of living a life that is pleasing to god apart from faith in christ but heres the good newsyou dont have to no amount of attempting to earn our way to god will ever cut it so are we passive in our salvation no our invitation is to cling to christ clinging to jesus means putting to death an old independent way of living its as if we ourselves have died yet we go on living but the life we now live in the body we live by faith in the son of god who loved us and gave himself for us galatians 2:20 where are we trying to walk the tightrope today god hasnt called us to walk out on the rope to him hes called us to cling to him and walk this life with him the problem within glenn packiam  january 26 a few years ago a woodpecker began tapping on the siding of our home we thought the problem was only external then one day my son and i climbed up a ladder into the attic only to have a bird fly past our startled faces the problem was worse than wed suspected: it was inside our house when jesus arrived in jerusalem the crowd was hoping he would be the one to fix their external problemtheir oppression by the romans they went wild shouting hosanna to the son of david blessed is he who comes in the name of the lord hosanna in the highest heaven matthew 21:9 this was the moment theyd been waiting for gods appointed king had come if gods chosen deliverer was going to begin reforming things wouldn't he start with all the wrong out there but in most gospel accounts the triumphal entry is followed by jesus driving out exploitative moneychangers    from the temple vv 12–13 he was cleaning house and from the inside out thats what happens when we welcome jesus as king he comes to set things rightand he starts with us he makes us confront the evil inside jesus on the donkey is like the warriors in the trojan horse the horse was welcomed as a symbol of peace but its ultimate aim was unconditional surrender jesus our king requires the same from us lift up your eyes glenn packiam  january 11 the clouds hung low blocking the horizon and limiting visibility to only a few hundred yards the minutes dragged on the effect on my mood was noticeable but then as afternoon approached the clouds began to break and i saw it: beautiful pikes peak the most recognizable landmark of my city flanked on each side by the mountain range a smile broke over my face i considered that even our physical perspectiveour literal line of sightcan affect our spiritual vision and i was reminded of the psalmist singing i lift my eyes to the mountains psalm 121:1 sometimes we simply need to lift our eyes a bit higher the psalmist pondered where his help came from maybe because the hilltops around israel were dotted with altars to pagan gods and often contained robbers or it could have been because the psalmist looked up beyond the hills to mount zion where the temple stood and remembered that the maker of heaven and earth was his covenant god v 2 either way to worship we must look up we have to lift our eyes higher than our circumstances higher than our troubles and trials higher than the empty promises of the false gods of our day then we can see the creator and redeemer the one who calls us by name hes the one who will watch over your coming and going today and forevermore v 8 a song in the night glenn packiam  december 27 the sun had long set when our electrical power suddenly went out i was at home with our two younger children and this was their first time experiencing a power outage after verifying that the utility company knew about the outage i located some candles and the kids and i huddled together in the kitchen around the flickering flames they seemed nervous and unsettled so we began to sing soon the concerned looks on their faces were replaced with smiles sometimes in our darkest moments we need a song         psalm 103 was prayed or sung after the people of god had returned from exile to a homeland that had been laid waste in a moment of crisis they needed to sing but not just any song they needed to sing about who god is and what he does psalm 103 also helps us remember that hes compassionate merciful patient and full of faithful love v 8 and in case we wonder if the judgment for our sin still hangs over our heads the psalm announces that god isnt angry has forgiven and feels compassion these are good things to sing during the dark nights of our lives maybe thats where you find yourself: in a dark and difficult place wondering if god really is good questioning his love for you if so pray and sing to the one who abounds in love load more our daily bread ministries po box 2222 grand rapids  mi 49501 616 9742210 odbodborg subscribe now to get the

the colorado symphony orchestra and the setting was the matchless venue at red rocksan openair amphitheater built between two three hundredfoot rock formations at more than 6000 feet above sea level the orchestra played a number of wellloved classical songs and folk tunes their final number was a fresh treatment of the classic hymn amazing grace the beautiful harmonized arrangement took our breath away theres something beautiful about harmonyindividual instruments playing together in a way that creates a bigger and more layered sonic landscape the apostle paul pointed to the beauty of harmony when he told the philippians to be likeminded have the same love and be one in spirit and    mind philippians 2:2 he wasnt asking them to become identical but to embrace the humble attitude and selfgiving love of jesus the gospel as paul well knew and taught doesnt erase our distinctions but it can eliminate our divisions its also interesting that pauls words here are a prelude for a song he quotes vv 6–11 heres the point: when we allow the holy spirit to work through our distinct lives and contexts making us more like jesus together we becomes a symphony that reverberates with a humble christlike love facing the darkness glenn packiam  may 18 in the mid1960s two people participated in research on the effects of darkness on the human psyche they entered separate caves while researchers tracked their eating and sleeping habits one remained in total darkness for 88 days the other 126 days each guessed how long they could remain in darkness and were off by months one took what he thought was a short nap only to discover hed slept for 30 hours darkness is disorienting the people of god found themselves in the darkness of impending exile they waited unsure of what would take place the prophet isaiah used darkness as a metaphor for their disorientation and as a way of speaking about gods judgment isaiah 8:22 previously the egyptians had been visited with darkness as a plague exodus 10:21–29 now it was israel that found herself in darkness but a light would come the people walking in darkness have seen a great light on those living in in the land of deep darkness a light has dawned isaiah 9:2 oppression would be broken disorientation would end a child would come to change everything and bring about a new daya day of forgiveness and freedom v 6 jesus did come and although the darkness of the world can be disorienting may we experience the comfort of the forgiveness freedom and light found in christ live like its morning glenn packiam  april 14 when i have to travel across time zones by air i try various remedies to avoid jet lag i think ive tried them all on one occasion i decided to adjust my inflight eating to the time zone where i was heading instead of eating dinner with the rest of the passengers i kept watching a movie and tried to fall asleep the hours of elective fasting were difficult and the breakfast that came right before we landed left much to be desired but living out of sorts with those around me worked it jolted my body clock into a new time zone paul knew that if believers in jesus were to truly reflect him in their lives they would need to live out of step with the world around them they were once darkness but now they were to live as children of light ephesians 5: 8 and what might that look like paul goes on to fill out the picture: the fruit of the light consists in all goodness justice and truth v 9 sleeping through dinner may have seemed foolish to the people on my flight but even as its midnight in the world as believers were called to live like its morning this may provoke scorn and opposition but in jesus we can walk in the way of love following the example of the one who loves us and gave himself up for us as a fragrant offering and sacrifice to god v 2 companions in christ glenn packiam  april 6 the harvard study of adult development is a decadeslong project thats resulted in a greater understanding of the importance of healthy relationships the research began with a group of 268 sophomores at harvard university in the 1930s and later expanded to among others 456 boston innercity residents researchers have conducted interviews with the participants and pored over their medical records every few years what theyve discovered is that close relationships are the biggest factor in predicting happiness and health it turns out that if we surround ourselves with the right people well likely experience a deeper sense of joy this appears to reflect what the apostle paul is describing in philippians 1 writing from prison paul cant help but tell his friends that he thanks god for them every time he remembers them praying with joy v 4 but these arent just any friends these are brothers and sisters in jesus who share in gods grace partners in the gospel with paul v 7 their relationship was one of sharing and mutualitya true fellowship shaped by gods love and the gospel itself yes friends are important but fellow companions in christ are catalysts of a true and deep joy the grace of god can bind us together like nothing else and even through the darkest seasons of life the joy that comes from that bond will last practice these things glenn packiam  march 10 as i helped my son with his math homework it began apparent he was less then enthusiastic about doing multiple problems related to the same concept ive got it dad he insisted hoping i would let him out doing all the problems i then gently explained to him that a concept is just a concept until we learn how to work it out in practice at the end of pauls letter to his friends in philippi he wrote about practice practice these things: whatever you learned received heard or saw in us philippians 4:9 here are five things he mentions: reconciliationas he urged euodia and syntyche to do vv 1–3 joyas he reminded his readers to cultivate v 4 gentlenessas he urged them to employ in their relation to the world v 5 prayeras he had modeled for them in person and in writing vv 6–7 and focusas he had shown even in prison v 8 reconciliation joy gentleness prayer and focusthings were called to live out as believers in jesus like any habit these virtues must be intentionally done in order to be cultivated but the good news of the gospel as paul had already told the philippians is that it is god who works in you to will and to act in order to fulfill his good purpose 2:13 were never practicing in our own power god will provide what we need 4:19 no longer yourself glenn packiam  february 27 in the summer of 1859 monsieur charles blondin became the first person to cross niagara falls on a tightropesomething he would go on to do hundreds of times once he did it with his manager harry colcord on his back blondin gave colcord these instructions: look up harry    you are no longer colcord you are blondin    if i sway sway with me do not attempt to do any balancing yourself if you do we will both go to our death paul in essence said to the galatian believers: you cant walk the line of living a life that is pleasing to god apart from faith in christ but heres the good newsyou dont have to no amount of attempting to earn our way to god will ever cut it so are we passive in our salvation no our invitation is to cling to christ clinging to jesus means putting to death an old independent way of living its as if we ourselves have died yet we go on living but the life we now live in the body we live by faith in the son of god who loved us and gave himself for us galatians 2:20 where are we trying to walk the tightrope today god hasnt called us to walk out on the rope to him hes called us to cling to him and walk this life with him the problem within glenn packiam  january 26 a few years ago a woodpecker began tapping on the siding of our home we thought the problem was only external then one day my son and i climbed up a ladder into the attic only to have a bird fly past our startled faces the problem was worse than wed suspected: it was inside our house when jesus arrived in jerusalem the crowd was hoping he would be the one to fix their external problemtheir oppression by the romans they went wild shouting hosanna to the son of david blessed is he who comes in the name of the lord hosanna in the highest heaven matthew 21:9 this was the moment theyd been waiting for gods appointed king had come if gods chosen deliverer was going to begin reforming things wouldn't he start with all the wrong out there but in most gospel accounts the triumphal entry is followed by jesus driving out exploitative moneychangers    from the temple vv 12–13 he was cleaning house and from the inside out thats what happens when we welcome jesus as king he comes to set things rightand he starts with us he makes us confront the evil inside jesus on the donkey is like the warriors in the trojan horse the horse was welcomed as a symbol of peace but its ultimate aim was unconditional surrender jesus our king requires the same from us lift up your eyes glenn packiam  january 11 the clouds hung low blocking the horizon and limiting visibility to only a few hundred yards the minutes dragged on the effect on my mood was noticeable but then as afternoon approached the clouds began to break and i saw it: beautiful pikes peak the most recognizable landmark of my city flanked on each side by the mountain range a smile broke over my face i considered that even our physical perspectiveour literal line of sightcan affect our spiritual vision and i was reminded of the psalmist singing i lift my eyes to the mountains psalm 121:1 sometimes we simply need to lift our eyes a bit higher the psalmist pondered where his help came from maybe because the hilltops around israel were dotted with altars to pagan gods and often contained robbers or it could have been because the psalmist looked up beyond the hills to mount zion where the temple stood and remembered that the maker of heaven and earth was his covenant god v 2 either way to worship we must look up we have to lift our eyes higher than our circumstances higher than our troubles and trials higher than the empty promises of the false gods of our day then we can see the creator and redeemer the one who calls us by name hes the one who will watch over your coming and going today and forevermore v 8 a song in the night glenn packiam  december 27 the sun had long set when our electrical power suddenly went out i was at home with our two younger children and this was their first time experiencing a power outage after verifying that the utility company knew about the outage i located some candles and the kids and i huddled together in the kitchen around the flickering flames they seemed nervous and unsettled so we began to sing soon the concerned looks on their faces were replaced with smiles sometimes in our darkest moments we need a song         psalm 103 was prayed or sung after the people of god had returned from exile to a homeland that had been laid waste in a moment of crisis they needed to sing but not just any song they needed to sing about who god is and what he does psalm 103 also helps us remember that hes compassionate merciful patient and full of faithful love v 8 and in case we wonder if the judgment for our sin still hangs over our heads the psalm announces that god isnt angry has forgiven and feels compassion these are good things to sing during the dark nights of our lives maybe thats where you find yourself: in a dark and difficult place wondering if god really is good questioning his love for you if so pray and sing to the one who abounds in love load more our daily bread ministries po box 2222 grand rapids  mi 49501 616 9742210 odbodborg subscribe now to get the

one day when i was deeply concerned about the welfare of one close to me i found encouragement in part of the old testament story of samuel a wise leader of the israelites as i read how samuel interceded for gods people as they faced trouble i strengthened my resolve to pray for the one i loved the israelites faced the threat of the philistines who had previously defeated them when gods people didnt trust in him see 1 samuel 4 after repenting of their sins they heard that the philistines were about to attack this time however they asked samuel to continue praying for them 7:8 and the lord answered clearly by throwing their enemy into confusion v 10 though the philistines may have been mightier than the israelites the lord was the strongest of them all god with us amy boucher pye

celtic christian st patrick echo in my mind when i read matthews account of jesuss birth they feel like a warm embrace reminding me that im never alone matthews account tells us that god dwelling with his people is at the heart of christmas quoting isaiahs prophecy of a child who would be called immanuel meaning god with us isa 7:14 matthew points to the ultimate fulfillment of that prophecyjesus the one born by the power of the holy spirit to be god with us this truth is so central that matthew begins and ends his gospel with it concluding with jesuss words to his disciples: and surely i am with you always to the very end of the age matt 28:20 waiting amy boucher pye  december 3 how much longer until its christmas when my children were little they asked this question repeatedly although we used a daily advent calendar to count down the days to christmas they still found the waiting excruciating we can easily recognize a childs struggle with waiting but we might underestimate the challenge it can involve for all of gods people consider for instance those who received the message of the prophet micah who promised that out of bethlehem would come a ruler over israel 5:2 who would stand and shepherd his flock in the strength of the lord v 4 the initial fulfillment of this prophecy came when jesus was born in bethlehem matt 2:1 after the people had waited some 700 years but some of the prophecys fulfillment is yet to come for we wait in hope for the return of jesus when all of gods people will live securely and his greatness will reach the ends of the earth v 4 then we will rejoice greatly for our long wait will be over our powerful god amy boucher pye  november 28 one day by the seaside i delighted in watching some kite surfers as they bounced along the water moved by the force of the wind when one came to shore i asked him if the experience was as difficult as it looked no he said its actually easier than regular surfing because you harness the power of the wind afterward as i walked by the sea thinking about the winds ability not only to propel the surfers but also to whip my hair into my face i paused to wonder at our god the creator as we see in the old testament book of amos he who forms the mountains and creates the wind can turn dawn to darkness v 13 a good ending amy boucher pye  november 9 as the lights dimmed and we prepared to watch

growing up in minnesota a place known for its many beautiful lakes i loved to go camping to enjoy the wonders of gods creation but sleeping in a flimsy tent wasnt my favorite part of the experienceespecially when a rainy night and a leaky tent resulted in a soggy sleeping bag i marvel to think that one of the heroes of our faith spent a hundred years in tents when he was 75 years old abraham heard gods call to leave his country so the lord could make him into a new nation gen 12:1–2 abraham obeyed trusting that god would follow through on his promise and for the rest of his life until he died at 175 25:7 he lived away from his home country in tents writing letters amy boucher pye  september 10 my mother and her sisters engage in what is increasingly becoming a lost art formwriting letters each week they pen personal words to each other with such consistency that one of their mailcarriers worries when he doesnt have something to deliver their letters brim with the stuff of life the joys and heartaches along with the daily happenings of friends and family i love to reflect on this weekly exercise of the women in my family it helps me appreciate even more the apostle pauls words that those who follow jesus are a letter from christ who were written not with ink but with the spirit of the living god 2 cor 3:3 in response to false teachers who wanted to discredit his message see 2 cor 11 paul encouraged the church in corinth to keep on following the true and living god as he had previously taught in doing so he memorably described the believers as christs letter with their transformed lives a more powerful witness to the spirit working through pauls ministry than any written letter could be made clean amy boucher pye  august 30 when i opened our dishwasher i wondered what went wrong instead of seeing sparkling clean dishes i removed plates and glasses that were covered in a chalky dust i wondered if the hard water in our area was wreaking havoc or if the machine was kaput gods cleansing unlike that faulty dishwasher washes away all of our impurities we see in the book of ezekiel that god is calling his people back to himself as ezekiel shared gods message of love and forgiveness the israelites had sinned as they proclaimed their allegiance to other gods and other nations the lord however was merciful in welcoming them back to himself he promised to cleanse them from all their impurities and all their idols v 25 as he put his spirit in them v 27 he would bring them to a place of fruitfulness not famine v 30 ripe for harvest amy boucher pye  august 22 in late summer we went for a walk in the new forest in england and had fun picking the blackberries that grew in the wild while watching the horses frolicking nearby as i enjoyed the bounty of the sweet fruit planted by others perhaps many years before i thought of jesuss words to his disciples: i sent you to reap what you have not worked for john 4:38  i love the generosity of gods kingdom reflected in those words he lets us enjoy the fruits of someone elses labors such as when we share our love for jesus with a friend whose familyunbeknown to ushas been praying for her for years i also love the implied limits of jesuss words for we may plant seeds that we will never harvest but someone else may therefore we can rest in the tasks before us not being hoodwinked into thinking that we are responsible for the outcomes gods work after all doesnt depend solely on us he has all of the resources for a bountiful harvest and we are privileged to play a role in it not fear but faith amy boucher pye  august 16 my husband was offered a promotion in another country but i feared leaving our home so he reluctantly declined the offer my friend explained how apprehension over such a big change kept her from embracing a new adventure and that she sometimes wondered what they missed in not moving the israelites let their anxieties paralyze them when they were called to inhabit a rich and fertile land that flowed with milk and honey ex 33:3 when they heard the reports of not only an abundance of fruit but also powerful people in large cities v 27 they started to fear the majority of the israelites rejected the call to enter the land a time for everything amy boucher pye  july 20 while flying recently i watched a mother and her children a few rows ahead of me while the toddler played contentedly the mother gazed into the eyes of her newborn smiling at him and stroking his cheek he stared back with a wideeyed wonderment i enjoyed the moment with a touch of wistfulness thinking of my own children at that age and the season that has passed me by i reflected however about king solomons words in the book of ecclesiastes about every activity under the heavens v 1 he addresses through a series of opposites how there is a time for everything v 1: a time to be born and a time to die a time to plant and a time to uproot v 2 perhaps king solomon in these verses despairs at what he sees as a meaningless cycle of life but he also acknowledges the role of god in each season that our work is a gift of god v 13 and that everything god does will endure forever v 14 face to face amy boucher pye  july 14 although the world is connected electronically like never before nothing beats time together in person as we share and laugh together we can often sensealmost unconsciouslythe other persons emotions by watching their facial movements those who love each other whether family or friends like to share with each other face to face we see this facetoface relationship between the lord and moses the man god chose to lead his people moses grew in confidence over the years of following god and he continued to follow him despite the peoples rebelliousness and idolatry after the people worshiped a golden calf instead of the lord see exod 32 moses set up a tent outside of the camp in which to meet god while they had to watch from a distance 33:7–11 as the pillar of cloud signifying gods presence descended to the tent moses spoke on their behalf the lord promised that his presence would go with them v 14 a day to rest amy boucher pye  july 8 one sunday i stood by the gurgling stream that wends its way through our north london community delighting in the beauty it brings to our otherwise builtup area i felt myself relax as i watched the cascading water and listened to the birds chirping i paused to give the lord thanks for how he helps us to find rest for our souls the lord instituted a time of sabbatha time for rest and renewalfor his people in the ancient near east because he wanted them to thrive as we see in the book of exodus he tells them to sow their fields for six years and rest on the seventh so too with working six days and resting on the seventh his way of life set apart the israelites from other nations for not only they but also the foreigners and slaves in their households were allowed to follow this pattern faith in action amy boucher pye  june 29 as a friend drove to the grocery store she noticed a woman walking along the side of the road and felt she should turn the car around and offer her a ride when she did she was saddened to hear that the woman didnt have money for the bus so was walking home many miles in the hot and humid weather not only was she making the long journey home but she had also walked several hours that morning to arrive at work by 4 am by offering a ride my friend put into practice in a modern setting jamess instruction for christians to live out their faith with their deeds: faith by itself if it is not accompanied by action is dead v 17 he was concerned that the church take care of the widows and the orphans james 1:27 and he also wanted them to

witnessed his miracles and learned from his teaching be better off without him but jesus told them that if he left then the advocatethe holy spiritwould come at home with jesus amy boucher pye  april 17 theres no place like home the phrase from popular culture reflects a deeply rooted yearning within us to have a place to rest be and belong jesus addressed this desire for rootedness when after he

for thema dwellingplace a home he made this place for themand usthrough fulfilling the requirements of gods law when he died on the cross as the sinless man he assured his disciples that if he went to

later or that at times id feel like i was losing my life as i said goodbye to family and friends work and all that was familiar but in losing my old way of life ive found a better one the upsidedown gift of finding life when we lose it is what jesus promised to his apostles when he sent out the twelve disciples to share his good news he asked them to love him more than their mothers or fathers

giving thanks for the break in weather and the amazing work god had done hundreds joined voices to worship god many felt liberated to sing wholeheartedly before god offering our hearts souls bodies and minds to him as i think back to that day decades later im reminded of the pure wonder and joy of praising god king david knew how to wholeheartedly worship god he rejoiced when the ark of the covenant which signified gods presence was placed in jerusalemby dancing leaping and celebrating 1 chronicles 15:29 even though his wife michal observed his abandon and despised him in her heart v 29 david didnt let her criticism stop him from worshiping the one true god even if he appeared undignified he wanted to give thanks to the lord for choosing him to lead the nation see 2 samuel 6:21–22 david  appointed asaph and his associates to give praise to the lord in this manner: give praise to the lord proclaim his name make known among the nations what he has done sing to him sing praise to him tell of all his wonderful acts 1 chronicles 16:7–9 may we too give ourselves fully to worshiping god by pouring out our praise and adoration gods plans for you amy boucher pye  october 15 for six years a woman tried to make herself the perfect ministers wife modeling herself after her adored motherinlaw also a pastors wife she thought that in this role she couldnt also be a writer and painter but in burying her creativity she became depressed and contemplated suicide only the help of a neighboring pastor moved her out of the darkness as he prayed with her and assigned her two hours of writing each morning this awakened her to what she called her sealed ordersthe calling god had given her she wrote for me to be really myselfmy complete selfevery    flow of creativity that god had given me had to find its channel later she pointed to one of davids songs that expressed how she found her calling: take delight in the lord and he will give you the desires of your heart psalm 37:4 as she committed her way to god trusting him to lead and guide her v 5 he made a way for her not only to write and paint but to help others to better communicate with him god has a set of sealed orders for each of us not only that well know were his beloved children but understand the unique ways we can serve him through our gifts and passions hell lead us as we trust and delight in him resting secure in god amy boucher pye  september 6 i wrote a letter to our children as each became a teenager in one i talked about our identity in christ remembering that when i was a teenager i felt unsure of myself lacking confidence i had to learn that i was gods belovedhis child i said in the letter knowing who you are comes down to knowing whose you are for when we understand that god has created us and we commit to following him we can be at peace with who he has made us to be and we also know that he changes us to be more like him each day a foundational passage from scripture about our identity as gods children is deuteronomy 33:12: let the beloved of the lord rest secure in him for he shields him all day long and the one the lord loves rests between his shoulders just before moses died this is the blessing he proclaimed over the tribe of benjamin as gods people prepared to enter the land hed promised them god wanted them to remember always that they were his beloved resting secure in their identity as his children knowing this identity is important equally for everyoneteenagers those in the middle of life and those who have lived a long time when we understand that god created us and watches over us we can find security hope and love    sharing jesus amy boucher pye  august 31 shortly after dwight moody 1837–99 came to faith in christ the evangelist resolved not to let a day pass without sharing gods good news with at least one person on busy days hed sometimes forget his resolution until late one night he was in bed before he remembered as he stepped outside he thought no one will be out in this pouring rain just then he saw a man walking down the street moody rushed over and asked to stand under his umbrella to avoid the rain when granted permission he asked have you any shelter in the time of storm could i tell you about jesus moody embodied a readiness to share how god saves us from the consequences of our sins he obeyed gods instructions to the israelites to proclaim his name and make known among the nations what he has done isaiah 12:4 not only were gods people called to proclaim that his name is exalted v 4 but they were also to share how the lord had become their salvation v 2 centuries later our call remains to tell the wonders of jesus becoming a man dying on the cross and rising again perhaps we heard about gods love when as moody did someone left their comfort zone to talk with us about jesus and we too each in our own way can let someone know about the one who saves seeking gods help amy boucher pye

the police department please call me at this number immediately the man began to worryafraid that somehow he had done something wrong he was afraid to return the call and he even spent sleepless nights running through possible scenariosworried that he was in some kind of trouble the officer never called back but it took weeks for the worry to go away jesus asked an interesting question about worry: can any of you by worrying add a single hour to your life matthew 6:27 perhaps this can help us rethink our tendency to worry because it suggests that it doesnt help the situation we are concerned about home dave branon  december 8 recently a friend who sold homes for a living died of cancer as my wife and i reminisced about patsy sue recalled that many years ago patsy had led a man to faith in jesus and he became a good friend of ours how encouraging to recall that patsy not only helped families find homes to live in here in our community but she also helped others make sure they had an eternal home as jesus prepared to go to the cross for us he showed a keen interest in our eternal accommodations he told his disciples i go to prepare a place for you and reminded them that there would be plenty of room in his fathers house for all who trusted him john 14:2  thanks for who god is dave branon  november 16 among the thousands of sentiments printed on greeting cards perhaps one of the most touching is this simple statement: thanks for being you if you receive that card you know that someone cares for you not because you did something spectacular for that person but because youre appreciated for your essence i wonder if this kind of sentiment might indicate for us one of the best ways to say thank you to god sure there are times when god intervenes in our lives in a tangible way and we say something like thank you lord for allowing me to get that job but most often we can simply say thank you god for being who you are a warm welcome for all dave branon  october 7 during a recent vacation my wife and i visited a famous athletic complex the gates were wide open and it appeared that we were welcome to visit we enjoyed touring the grounds and admiring the wellmanicured sports fields as we were about to leave someone stopped us and coldly told us we were not supposed to be there suddenly we were reminded that we were outsidersand it felt uncomfortable on that vacation we also visited a church again the doors were open so we walked in what a difference many people greeted us warmly and made us feel right at home we walked out of that church service knowing we were welcomed and accepted unlocking a mystery dave branon  september 30 when i came home from work one day and saw a pair of ladys highheel shoes next to the driveway i was sure i knew whose they were so i put them in the garage to give to my daughter lisa when she returned to the house to pick up her children but when i checked with lisa i found they didnt belong to her in fact no one in our family claimed them so i put them back where id found them the next day they were gone mysterious did you know that the apostle paul wrote of a mystery in his letters but the mystery he described was so much more than some kind of whodunit in ephesians 3 for example paul spoke of a mystery that was not made known to people in other generations v 5 this mystery is that while in the past god revealed himself through israel now through jesus gentilesthose outside of israelcould be heirs together with israel v 6 good for you dave branon  september 15 because i like dark chocolate i sometimes google is dark chocolate good for you i get a variety of resultssome good some bad you can do the same for almost any food product is milk good for you is coffee good for you is rice good for you there is a dizzying array of answers to these questions so you have to be aware that the search itself may not be good for you it may give you a headache but if you are looking for something that is onehundredpercent good for you all the time can i recommend the word of god listen to what it can do for the follower of jesus who is seeking to build his relationship with god to my dear friend dave branon  august 3 what the apostle john did for his friend gaius in the first century is a dying art in the twentyfirst century john wrote him a letter one writer for the new york times catherine field said letterwriting is among our most ancient of arts think of letters and the mind falls on paul of tarsus for example and we can add the apostle john in his letter to gaius john included hopes for good health of body and soul an encouraging word about gaiuss faithfulness and a note about his love for the church john also spoke of a problem in the church which john promised to address individually later and he wrote of the value of doing good things for gods glory all in all it was an encouraging and challenging letter to his friend hope anyway dave branon  july 22 among the hundreds of articles ive written for our daily bread since 1988 a few stick in my mind one such article is from the mid 1990s when i told of a time that our three girls were away at camp or on mission trips so sixyearold steve and i had some guy time as we were enjoying an excursion to the airport steve turned to me and said its not as much fun without melissa his eightyearold sister and sidekick neither of us knew then how poignant those words would turn out to be life indeed has not been as much fun for the years since mell died in a car accident as a teenager the passage of time may dull the ache but nothing takes the pain away completely time cannot heal that wound but heres something that can help: listening to meditating on and savoring the solace promised by the

never said anything to me ive never heard god talk to me             most of us would probably agree with maggie if hearing an audible voice telling us sell your house and go take care of orphans in a

tempted to turn our back on him when the terrain gets tough             if youve ever considered doing that think about the people of israel when they were given freedom from the egyptians after hundreds of years of bondage they took off for the promised land but god didnt send them straight home he did not lead them on the road through the philistine country though that was shorter ex 13:17

says he found the jews working on the temple and asks the king if they had permission to do so the letter also records the jews respectful response that they had indeed been given permission by an earlier king cyrus to rebuild when the king checked out their story he found it to be true: king cyrus had said they could build the temple so darius not only gave them permission to rebuild but he also paid for it see 6:112 after the jews finished building the temple they celebrated with joy because they knew god had changed the attitude of the king 6:22 growing up dave branon  february 28

have been used to provide electricity for homes businesses and communities around the world ac is much more efficient at sending electricity across great distances and proved to be the wiser choice

far beyond superficial alterations of course trusting jesus as savior makes us a new creation for the holy spirit lives within us but theres still some ongoing work the spirit needs to do and it takes

after one man knocked the other off the stage the crowd called out to him to let it go they were telling him to squash the beef the bible contains many examples of people beefing cain held a grudge against his brother abel because god accepted abels offering over his genesis 4:5 this grudge was so severe that it eventually led to murder as cain attacked his brother    and killed him v 8 esau held a grudge against jacob because jacob stole the birthright that was rightfully his 27:41 this grudge was so intense that it caused jacob to run for his life in fear not only does the bible give us

his finger was on the 2 key resulting in a 222 million euro 300 million dollars transfer into the customers account the fallout from the mistake included the firing of the employees colleague who verified the transfer although the mistake was caught and corrected because he wasnt watchful the sleepy employees lapse almost became a nightmare for the bank jesus warned his disciples that if they

known in his earthly life he asked peter james and john to stay awake to pray and keep watch with him matthew 26:38 but they fell asleep vv 40–41 their failure to watch and pray would leave them defenseless when the real temptation of denying him came calling in the hour of jesus greatest need the disciples lacked spiritual vigilance may we heed jesus words to remain spiritually awake by

three days a patrol plane spotted their lifeboat and the uss broome rescued the men the next day thanks to that compass semenov and twentysix other crewmembers were saved          the psalmist reminded gods people that they were equipped with a compass for lifethe bible he compared scripture to a lamp psalm 119:105 that provides light to illuminate the path of life for those pursuing god when the psalmist was adrift in the chaotic waters of life he knew god could use scripture to provide spiritual longitude and latitude and help him survive thus he prayed that god would send out his

one who would change things forever through the prophet isaiah god directed king ahaz to ask him for a sign to strengthen his faith isaiah 7:10–11 though the king refused to ask for a sign god gave him one anyway: the virgin will conceive and give birth to a son and will call him immanuel v 14 god named the child and he would be a sign of hope to people going through despair the name stuck and matthew breathed new meaning into it when he wrote the narrative of jesus birth 1:23 jesus too would be immanuel he wouldnt just be a representative of god but he would be god in the flesh coming to rescue his people from the despair of sin god gave us a sign the sign is a son the sons name is immanuelgod with us its a name that reflects his presence and love today he invites us to embrace

saddened but also grateful the teen was open to receiving the serious help she desperately needed the teen in some way represents many people who have carved emptyperhaps not on their forearms but on their hearts john wrote that jesus came to fill the empty and to offer life to the full john 10:10 god placed the desire for a full life in every human being and he longs for people to experience a loving relationship with him but he also warned them that the thief would use people things and circumstances to attempt to ravage their lives vv 1 10 the claims each made to give life would be counterfeit and an imitation in contrast jesus offers whats trueeternal life and the promise that no one will snatch us out of his hand v 28 only jesus can fill the empty spaces in our hearts with life if youre feeling empty call out to him today and if youre experiencing serious struggles seek out godly counsel christ alone provides life thats abundant and fulllife full of meaning found in him

joy in the meaningless and mundane he pursued work bought flocks built wealth acquired singers and constructed buildings ecclesiastes 2:4–9 some of these pursuits were honorable and some were not ultimately in his pursuit of meaning the king found nothing but boredom v 11 solomon maintained a worldview that didnt press beyond the limits of human experience to include god ultimately however he realized that he would find joy in the mundane only when he remembered and worshiped god 12:1–7 when we find ourselves in the whirlwind of tedium lets launch our own daily miniconference as we

help us be set free from our sin v 18 paul then describes the difference between being a slave to sin and a slave to god and his lifegiving ways vv 19–20 he continues by stating that the wages of sin is death but the gift of god is eternal life v 23 death means being separated from god forever this is the devastating outcome we face when we reject christ but god has offered us a gift in jesusnew life its the kind of life that begins on earth and continues forever in heaven with him pauls beginners guide to eternal life leaves us with two choiceschoosing sin which leads to death or choosing

unpleasant memories he reminds us that the lord bids good riddance to our sins in his attempt to express gods vast love for his people the psalmist used word pictures he compared the vastness of the lords love to the distance between the heavens and the earth psalm 103:11 then he talked about gods forgiveness in spatial terms as far as the place where the sun rises is from the place where the sun
